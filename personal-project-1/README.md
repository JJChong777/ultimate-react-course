Personal project number 1 that showcases the power of react, create-react-app and useState to make a dynamic prototype of a fictional toy store

Issues: 1. Images can take very long to load when switching from toy page to toy page 2. Not mobile friendly

Deployed on netlify here: https://jjchong-toystore.netlify.app/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

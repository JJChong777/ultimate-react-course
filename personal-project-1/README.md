Personal project number 1 that showcases the power of react, create-react-app and useState to make a dynamic prototype of a fictional toy store

Issues: Images can take very long to load when switching from toy page to toy page

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
